Description:
The Ratel is the basic Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) of the South African National Defence Force's mechanized infantry battalions, and is named after an African animal known in English as the Honey Badger, which has a reputation as a ferocious fighter. The 6x6 Ratel was indigenously developed and produced for the South African Army in order to circumvent the arms embargo of South Africa.
